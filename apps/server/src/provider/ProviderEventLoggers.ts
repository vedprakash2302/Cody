/**
 * ProviderEventLoggers — single observability service that owns the shared
 * provider event log store and exposes its two runtime views:
 *
 *   - `native`    — provider-protocol events as the SDK emits them, written
 *                   from inside each `<X>Adapter` factory.
 *   - `canonical` — runtime events after `ProviderService` has normalized
 *                   them onto `ProviderRuntimeEvent`.
 *
 * Why a service tag and not constructor options?
 *
 *   - Adapters are now constructed *inside* drivers (`<X>Driver.create()`),
 *     not at the boot Layer. There is no longer a single `make<X>AdapterLive(options)`
 *     call site where we can hand an `EventNdjsonLogger` in by hand.
 *   - Multiple driver instances per kind (`codex_personal`, `codex_work`)
 *     must share one underlying log store — opening N writers against the
 *     same rotating file would race the rotation logic. Owning the loggers on
 *     a single tag keeps that invariant intact.
 *   - Tests can swap one (or both) loggers with in-memory recorders by
 *     `Layer.succeed(ProviderEventLoggers, { native, canonical })` instead of
 *     juggling per-Layer option threading.
 *
 * Both fields are optional because observability must not prevent startup.
