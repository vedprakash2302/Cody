const PULL_REQUEST_LINKING_INSTRUCTIONS = `<pull_request_linking>
When the t3-code MCP server exposes link_pull_request, you must use it to register every pull request you create or work on for this thread. Call link_pull_request with the full PR URL immediately after creating a PR or starting work on an existing PR. For a stack, call it for every layer, not just the current branch or the top PR. This applies when creating or updating PRs through gh, gh stack, another CLI, or the host API: those operations do not register the PRs with this thread. Linking an already-linked PR is safe. Before finishing PR work, call list_thread_pull_requests and link any PR from your work that is missing. Do not link unrelated PRs mentioned only as background. If a linking call fails, report that failure instead of claiming the PR is linked.

// T3 Code collapses a finished turn's earlier messages and keeps its last one
// visible, so an answer followed by a separate status line ("I've closed the
// browser.") ends up hidden. Every client, including installed mobile apps the
// server cannot update, benefits when the answer comes last.
const FINAL_ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS = `<final_answer>
T3 Code keeps the last message of a finished turn visible and may collapse earlier ones. Complete any required cleanup and final tool calls before writing your final answer, and keep resources running when the user needs them. Do not append a separate status-only message after the answer; mention cleanup inside the answer if it matters.
